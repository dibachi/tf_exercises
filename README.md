# tf_exercises
repo for tensorflow exercises

I found these exercises on Twitter, in a GitHub repo made by Damien Aymeric ðŸ‘‰https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples
However, the exercises for TensorFlow 2.0 are both written in Jupyter notebooks and contain some deprecated libraries and functions.
As an exercise in both Python script-writing and in machine learning, I decided to rewrite these scripts as .py files I can run from terminal.
I have experience with introductory machine learning and have written some of my own basic algorithms, but working with the TensorFlow libraries 
gives me a chance to practice using more advanced machine learning packages.
